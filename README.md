# Diverse Priors
Can we combine representations of different models to improve label efficiency and robustness?


## Getting Started

To setup the feature extraction and benchmark:

```bash
cd benchmark
pip install .
```

Scripts to run feature extraction and evaluation of combined models are found in `benchmark/scripts`. 
To check if you set up everything correctly, you can run `./benchmark/scripts/test_scripts/test_single.sh`.
